# DiscordIRC

This is not your typical Discord <-> IRC bridge bot.


###This bot is designed to be on a ***private*** Discord guild with only 1 user (you).


All messages sent in chat will be forwarded to IRC as the bot's username. This acts more like a personal irc bouncer, but on Discord.

Each category in the guild must be named as an IRC network's address (such as `irc.esper.net`).

Each text channel in this category will connect the bot to that channel in that IRC network.

Voice channels and any channel not in a category are ignored.

Better documentation will come later (maybe..)
